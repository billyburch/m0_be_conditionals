# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
*Conditionals give us more control over what a program does by using "if,then" statements. These statements/lines of code instruct the program what actions to take based on the information it is given.*
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
*I would aim for more git commits as I completed like steps. I would also like to become more efficient and fluid with my decision making around each line of code.*
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
*In addition to feeling more confident with the embedded terminal in VS Code, and the git workflow, I found some satisfaction in finding solutions to my problems through sites outside of the mod0 materials. For example, I was able to learn that I can check for a substring by using the ==~ command followed by /sub_string/. I was also happy to find success with interpolating the password into my code when required.
